# WebSocial

WebSocial is an open source, federated social networking platform that is mediated by RSS/Atom.  Like other social networks, it allows users to "microblog" and follow other users whose posts will appear in their feeds.  Unlike other services, it allows users to follow RSS feeds as if they were other users.  WebSocial also provides an RSS feed for each user, enabling users on other servers to follow them, whether they're using another WebSocial server, or an RSS reader.

Disclaimer: WebSocial is currently in prototype status, and needs a new name, as there is already an existing, unrelated service by this name.
